Nova Threefry
=============

**Nova** is a language and runtime compiler that produces code for [Singular Computing](https://www.singularcomputing.com/)'s forthcoming [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) computer, which is based in part on approximate arithmetic.  For example, the assignment `A = B + C` would be written in Nova as `Set(A, Add(B, C))`, yielding a hardware `Add` instruction and possibly some data movement instructions such as `Set`, `Load`, and `Store`.

**Threefry** is a counter-based random-number generator from [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)'s [Random123](https://github.com/DEShawResearch/random123) suite.

**Nova Threefry** is a port of Threefry to Nova.

Rationale
---------

Singular Computing's hardware is architected for massive scalability.  Because the compute cores are designed to be extremely simple, they require very little space and power.  Consequently, huge numbers of them can be packed into a single chip.  Just a few compute boards or racks can provide phenomenal peak performance.

The Threefry algorithm is an excellent match to the Singular Computing hardware in that it requires only very simple integer operations (adds, exclusive ORs, and rotates) and virtually no per-core state yet can produce a large number of independent streams of pseudo-random numbers that exhibit a reasonably long period and pass [TestU01](http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html)'s SmallCrush, Crush, and BigCrush statistical tests.

Caveats
-------

Nova Threefry relies on Singular Computing's proprietary Nova library, for which the source code is not currently generally available.  Consequently, for most people, this repository serves primarily as an example of what's involved in porting a state-of-the-art random-number generator to a contemporary SIMD computer.  However, [Singular Computing](https://www.singularcomputing.com/) welcomes inquiries from parties interested in exploring its currently available hardware systems.
